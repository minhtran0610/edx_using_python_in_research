# edx_using_python_in_research
This is my work during the course Using Python in Research by Harvard University on edX.

The files in the repository includes the Python codes in the course Using Python in Research. I studied this course while it is free, so
the last project is not available.

The content of the course mainly covers the usage of different libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib to use Python for processing numerical data.
